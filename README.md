# project-edit-viewer

I want you to create an internal tool that allows user to upload a csv file containg data about projects and a series of edits. 

User should be able to:
- Make sure you only process rows that have type=ai_update
-  select (dropdown) and filter by project ID (the first id in the path) and then see all the code edits in order of creation
- each edit, should show the content stored in tags.output with pretty print
- each edit (if status is not failed) should also diplay the commit sha

Here is an example of the first rows of the CSV could, look this is just an example!!!

__path__	__id__	__created__	__updated__	code_blocks	commit_sha	created_at	created_by	error_message	error_type	id	messages	num_of_edits	number	prompt	response	revert_target_edit_id	reverted	screenshot_url	status	tags	type
